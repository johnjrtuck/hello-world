Hi, my name is John Tucker. I am an electrical engineering major at Rice University located in Houston, Texas.
I am a freshman and lowkey know nothing about coding and this is where I start.
A little more about me, I am co-president of the University's IEEE club (acronym meaning) and thus have vast leadership and technical experience about what it means to be an electrical engineer.
